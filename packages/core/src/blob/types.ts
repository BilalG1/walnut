/**
 * The `BlobProvider` abstraction — the storage analog of `DatabaseProvider`. It is the
 * provider-agnostic seam over a "dumb", content-addressed, immutable object store: it knows
 * nothing about branches, scopes, or the manifest. All branch intelligence lives in the
 * Postgres layered manifest; this interface only moves opaque bytes by physical key.
 *
 * Two implementations, mirroring `local`/`neon` for the database:
 *  - `local` — MinIO in docker-compose, for tests/offline dev.
 *  - `s3`    — any remote S3-compatible store in production: Cloudflare R2, Railway Buckets
 *              (Tigris), a hosted MinIO, etc. They differ only in endpoint/credentials and
 *              addressing style (see `pathStyle`), not behaviour.
 * Both speak S3, so prod and local exercise the same code path (see `s3.ts`).
 *
 * Bytes never stream through the API: callers mint short-TTL, single-object presigned URLs
 * and the client PUTs/GETs directly, so the API never buffers a blob (no `runSql`-style OOM
 * surface). The API + presign logic is the ONLY enforcement layer for blobs (unlike the DB,
 * there is no engine-level backstop), so authorization happens at presign time over the
 * resolved `(branch, path)` — never by trusting a client-supplied key.
